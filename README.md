- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Crime Analysis in Boston


<h3> Overview </h3>

This is Data Analysis of crime in Boston from June 14, 2015 to September 18, 2018. Crime in Boston is a very interesting topic for exploration.Personally, I have been living in Greater-Boston for three years and crime here is always a topic of conversation with friends and family. Another reason is the availability of huge amounts of publicly available (high quality) crime datasets open for data scientists to mine and investigates such as this one, and This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred.

This project can show regions which have high probability for crime occurrence, visulize crime prone areas, forecast the crimes occurrence and analyze the crime rates over the yrars. This helps to perform descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis on crime data.
